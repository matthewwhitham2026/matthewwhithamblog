A digital journal that's equal parts practice and expression.\n\nEvery day, I'll show up here. Some days will bring polished pieces. Others will be raw, unfinished thoughts. Both are welcome. Both are necessary.\n\n> The act of creation is itself the destination.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what this will become. A collection of essays? A visual diary? A record of creative evolution? Probably all of these things, shifting and changing as I do.\n\nWhat I do know is this: I believe in showing up. In the power of daily practice. In the magic that happens when you commit to making something, anything, every single day.\n\nThank you for being here at the start. Let's see where this goes."
