        <article class="post-content" id="post-content">
            <p class="drop-cap">There's a particular kind of haunting that comes from the half-done. The canvas with its first strokes still wet in your mind. The sentence that trails off into white space, waiting for words that haven't arrived yet.</p>

            <p>I've been thinking about thresholds lately—those liminal spaces between what was and what might be. My grandmother used to say that doorways were sacred, that you should never linger in them too long or you'd get stuck between worlds.</p>

            <div class="post-image-container floating-right">
                <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="Artwork" class="post-image">
                <span class="image-caption">Untitled study, 2026</span>
            </div>

            <p>Maybe that's what creative work is. Standing in doorways. Lingering deliberately in the in-between, trying to bring something back from the other side.</p>

            <p>Today I started three different pieces. Finished none. But finishing isn't always the point, is it? Sometimes the point is the reaching. The attempt. The willingness to stand at the edge of what you know and lean forward into the dark.</p>

            <p class="pull-quote">"The unfinished is not the failed. It is the still-becoming."</p>

            <p>I used to think productivity meant completion. Checkmarks and crossed-off lists. Now I'm learning to measure differently. Did I show up? Did I try? Did I let myself be changed by the work, even if the work itself remains unfinished?</p>

            <p>There's courage in the incomplete. In letting something exist in its raw state, vulnerable and unpolished. In trusting that the next layer will come when it's ready.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow I'll return to those three pieces. Or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll start something entirely new. The point isn't the destination. The point is that I keep walking through doorways, even when I can't see what's on the other side.</p>
